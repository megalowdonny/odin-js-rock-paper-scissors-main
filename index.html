<!-- AFTER COMPLETION NOTES
  This wasn't too hard to get all laid out, and my logic actually worked fine without any tweaking necessary.
  The problem came with me thinking I needed to list the playerChoice and computerChoice variables
  as parameters for the playRound() function. Since they're global variables, I don't need to do that, and because
  I was listing them as variables, their values kept getting set to undefined whenever the playRound() function
  tried to work with them. Eliminating all parameters on the playRound function fixed the problem immediately.
